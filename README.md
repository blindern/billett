## Setup

### Requirements
* PHP 5.4+

#### Composer
Composer is a package manager for PHP. It is used to install the Laravel framework and other third party packages we use. See https://getcomposer.org/download/

#### npm (package manager for node.js)
A lot of tools we use are javascript tools which we need `npm` to install. This should probably be installed system wide with `sudo apt-get install npm` or similar, and will also make sure Node.js is installed so we can run these applications.

### Initial setup
* Make sure requirements are met
* Set up configuration (see section below)
* Install PHP-dependencies:<br>```$ composer install```
* Install global Node.js-tools (might need sudo):<br>```$ npm install -g gulp bower```
* Load required Node.js-tools:<br>```$ npm install```
* Install bower-dependencies: (bower is installed above with npm)<br>```$ bower install```
* Continue on updating section

### Updating
* If `composer.json` is changed, install new PHP-dependencies:<br>```$ composer install```
* If `packages.json` is changed, install new npm-dependencies:<br>```$ npm install```
* If `bower.json` is changed, install new bower-dependencies:<br>```$ bower install```
* Regenerate static files:<br>```gulp production``` (see development section for development tips)

### Developing
* When javascript/scss-sources are changed, new static files must be compiled. The easiest way to handle this is to make gulp run in background and watch files:<br>```$ gulp watch```
* or you may manually create the static files every time:<br>```$ gulp```

### Configuration
Create the file ```/.env.php```:
```php
<?php
return array(
	'BILLETT_KEY' => 'REPLACE',
	'BILLETT_MYSQL_PASS' => 'REPLACE'
);
?>
```

There are also environment configuration stored in `/app/config/ENVIRONMENT/`, where `ENVIRONMENT` is configured in `/bootstrap/start.php`. This overrides configuration files in `/app/config/`.
